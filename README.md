# Drawing with Python
## Computer Graphics studies using Python

This project is a part of the curriculum for the university course on Computer Graphics. Its primary objective is to explore the application of the four universes paradigm for modeling both 2D and 3D objects.

### The Four Universes Paradigm
* **Physical/Metaphysical Universe:** Begins with photographs or images of the objects to be modeled.
* **Mathematical Universe:** Defines the basic geometric shapes (points, lines, polygons, or polyhedrons) that make up the model derived from the physical universe.
* **Universe of Representation:** Depicts the model using freehand sketches or drawing software, based on the shapes determined in the mathematical universe.
* **Implementation Universe:** Translates the model into code, implemented using Python.

### Tools and Technologies
* **Mathematical and Representation Universes:** The GeoGebra application was utilized for visualizing and defining the mathematical aspects, and for representing the model visually.
* **Implementation Universe**: The implementation was carried out using the Open Source Computer Vision and Matplotlib libraries within the Python environment.

### Objects

The 2D objects modeled, sequentially, include a cloud, a person, a house, and a landscape.
